These files are from my own Home Assistant install - you'll need to make your own tweaks, and I'm not responsible for any problems that come. 

You'll need to also add the relevant !include statements for each file. 

eg: template: !include <nameoftemplatefile>.yaml. 

You're also seeing INCOMPLETE configs here. I've removed PII and sensitive info, which is why I'm not including my Automations or my Scenes at this time (I need to go through and clean those up) 

I'll work to add missing helpers and integration as needed to make this all work, along with details of the various add-ons I've used.
